BOUNTY HOLD'EM - STRATEGIC GUIDELINES
====================================

GENERAL STRATEGY
----------------
1. Use same preflop sizing regardless of bounty in hand

PRE-FLOP STRATEGY
----------------
1. Hand Strength Categories

2. Position-Based Adjustments
   Button (Dealer):
   
   Big Blind:

3. Bounty Considerations
   - Increase hand value by X% when holding bounty card
   - Premium hands with bounty card should always raise
   - Marginal hands with bounty potential warrant more aggression

FLOP STRATEGY
------------
1. Hit Categories
   - Monster: Set, Two Pair+
   - Strong: Top Pair Good Kicker, Overpair
   - Draw: Flush Draw, Open-Ended Straight
   - Weak: Bottom Pair, No Pair

2. Bounty Board Texture
   - Prioritize continuation betting when bounty card appears
   - Consider pot control with strong hands without bounty potential
   - Factor 1.5x multiplier into pot odds calculations

3. Betting Guidelines
   - Bet 1/2 pot as standard sizing
   - Bet 3/4 pot with strong hands + bounty potential
   - Check-raise wider with bounty cards in range

TURN & RIVER STRATEGY
--------------------
1. Value Betting
   - Increase sizing with bounty activation potential
   - Target 3 streets of value with strong hands
   - Consider opponent stack-to-pot ratio (SPR)

2. Bluffing Guidelines
   - Bluff more frequently when holding bounty blocker
   - Reduce bluffing frequency against likely bounty hands
   - Use smaller sizing for bluffs (1/3 pot)

3. River Adjustments
   - Factor in both pot odds and bounty odds
   - Call wider when bounty card is on board
   - Value bet thinner with active bounty potential

OPPONENT MODELING
----------------
1. Track Frequencies
   - Pre-flop raise %
   - Continuation bet %
   - Fold to 3-bet %
   - River aggression %

2. Bounty Patterns
   - Note betting patterns when bounty cards appear
   - Track sizing tells with bounty hands
   - Adjust to opponent's bounty awareness

3. Exploitative Adjustments
   - Increase bluffing vs nitty opponents
   - Value bet wider vs calling stations
   - Adjust sizing based on opponent tendencies

MATHEMATICAL CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------
1. Standard Pot Odds
   Base Formula: Required_Equity = Risk / (Risk + Reward)

2. Bounty-Adjusted Odds
   Modified Formula: Required_Equity = Risk / (Risk + (Reward * 1.5 + 10))

3. Expected Value Calculation
   EV = (Win_Probability * (Pot + Bounty_Value)) - Risk
